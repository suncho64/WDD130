    		<h2>Coba</h2>
    		<p>Your encounter with the Mayan culture starts with a 1,500-year-old historical journey to the ancestral city of Coba, an archaeological site hidden deep inside the rain forest of the southeastern end of the Yucatan Peninsula. This quiet and peaceful archaeological site dates from 600-900 AD., at once it was the heart of a large metropolis composed of many cities within the southeastern Yucatan Peninsula. We’ll explore these Mayan ruins riding bikes or hiking. Climbing the Nohoch Muul temple (the tallest pyramid of the state measuring 140ft tall approx.), you will be able to admire the pristine beauty and immeasurable vastness of the surrounding subtropical jungle. 
				These are the largest ruins near Cancun, Mexico. They are also the most recently uncovered, and restoration is still taking place. 
				This journey then leads you to an authentic Mayan village, a self-sufficient Mayan community living not too far from the archaeological site. You will walk through the forest, learning the mysteries of their local fauna and flora. You’ll be able to see their lifestyle and wildlife. Afterwards, you will swim in a fresh water underground cave cenote.
				Mounting bikes are provided. A taxi-tricycle is available for mom and babies. At times, there are also smaller bikes available for children ages 7-11 (otherwise, there are taxi tricycles for them too). This tour is one of the best family tours we offer. You can climb most of the buildings, visit an authentic Mayan village, and even swim in a genuine, fresh water Cenote.</p>
