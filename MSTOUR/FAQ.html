			<summary class="question">What can you do to maintain proper attention by the waiters at restaurants?</summary>
		
			<p class="answere">It is very common that waiters offer poor service and attention to clients that do not consume alcoholic beverages due to the fact that in most restaurants here in the Riviera Maya and Cancun area, they receive commissions for their sales. For that reason, it is best to not mention that you will not be consuming alcohol, instead keep their interest on you by simply telling them that further on you’ll consider it an option</p>

			<summary class="question">Can we climb the buildings in the sites?</summary>
		
			<p class="answere">Crowds climbing the temples represent a high risk of accidents and cause a lot of damage. Please note that most of the temples in the Mayan area are at least 1500 years old. All the temples and buildings have ropes on the steps indicating how far you can go. There are only few structures available for climbing in the area such as "Coba, Ek Balam, those have the most spectacular view".</p>
