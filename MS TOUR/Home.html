    		<h2>More Than a Tour</h2>
    		<p>CHICHEN ITZA If you come to Cancun, add an incredible touch of culture and history to your vacation and visit one of the most amazing archaeological sites in Mexico: Chichen Itza. Book this incredible LDS tour to Chichen Itza and learn about the correlation with the Mayas and the people from the Book of Mormon. Enjoy a pleasant tour with our expert LDS tour guides and take off on a shopping spree after the tour with the local vendors at the souvenir market at Chichen Itza. After, delight your senses tasting the local Yucatan cuisine at our favorite restaurant and enjoy dishes such as Cochinita Pibil, torta Española, and many other local specialties. Our last stop is a Cenote for swimming and cooling off after a sunny day visiting the ruins! Additional information: Chichen Itza is an ancient city built by the Mayan civilization. The name means "at the mouth of the well of the Itza" referring to the people and their devotion to a massive sacred well (cenote) located within the city boundaries. It is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World since 2007. At these ruins, you will be amazed by magnificent temples such as the Kukulcan Pyramid, the Temple of the Columns and the Pok Ta Pok Ball Court. Dominating the center of Chichen Itza is the Kukulkan pyramid commonly known as El Castillo (the castle). The step pyramid was dedicated to Kukulkan (the Mayan name for Quetzalcoatl, the Mesoamerican deity whose name means feathered serpent). It is a square-based pyramid that has stairs going up each of the four sides, leading to Kukulkan’s altar on the top. The building was designed so that at the equinoxes, the rising and setting of the sun casts a shadow in the shape of a plumed serpent that slithers down the northern side of the pyramid to the serpent’s head at the base. TULUM Join us on a tour to Tulum ruins and add a refreshing plunge into a natural Cenote; but not just any, try the world-famous “ Cenote.” Known for its caverns connected to a 55-mile underground river system. An excellent place to cool off and to enjoy the natural wonders of the Yucatan península. On this tour, our first stop is Tulum. We enjoy the ruins and the mind-blowing information our expert tour guide will share with us. Then, we continue to have lunch and choose from 5 different traditional Mexican dishes such as chiles rellenos, beef fajitas, grilled fish and more! Last but not least, the Cenote awaits us for a breathtaking swim in a natural pool in the jungle! CENOTE In case you haven't heard of a cenote before, a cenote (pronounced seh-no-tay) is a natural sinkhole caused by the collapse of the surrounding limestone. When this phenomenon happens, it exposes groundwater, creating a natural pool. Cenotes are perfect for swimming and snorkeling, with clear fresh water and sometimes aquatic life such as turtles and small fish. COBA Your encounter with the Mayan culture starts with a 1,500-year-old historical journey to the ancestral city of Coba, an archaeological site hidden deep inside the rain forest of the southeastern end of the Yucatan Peninsula. This quiet and peaceful archaeological site dates from 600-900 AD., at once it was the heart of a large metropolis composed of many cities within the southeastern Yucatan Peninsula. We’ll explore these Mayan ruins riding bikes or hiking. Climbing the Nohoch Muul temple (the tallest pyramid of the state measuring 140ft tall approx.), you will be able to admire the pristine beauty and immeasurable vastness of the surrounding subtropical jungle. These are the largest ruins near Cancun, Mexico. They are also the most recently uncovered, and restoration is still taking place. This journey then leads you to an authentic Mayan village, a self-sufficient Mayan community living not too far from the archaeological site. You will walk through the forest, learning the mysteries of their local fauna and flora. You’ll be able to see their lifestyle and wildlife. Afterwards, you’ll swim in a fresh water underground cave cenote. Mounting bikes are provided. A taxi-tricycle is available for mom and babies. At times, there are also smaller bikes available for children ages 7-11 (otherwise, there are taxi tricycles for them too). This tour is one of the best family tours we offer. You can climb most of the buildings, visit an authentic Mayan village, and even swim in a genuine, fresh water Cenote. EK BALAM Book an LDS tour to Ek Balam and visit the oldest Mayan capital of the Yucatan Peninsula, considered by many LDS scholars to be a possible Nephite settlement. The enigmatic and mysterious ruins of Ek Balam, where once covered strategically by its founders to protect the sacred symbols and statues in the chambers of the Holy Acropolis. Today, MS Tours invites you to join us on an excursion to visit these hidden ruins deep in the tropical jungle where we may climb temples and pyramids and learn from our expert LDS tour guides about the correlation of the Book of Mormon and the city of Ek Balam. Visit the ruins of Ek Balam, followed by a refreshing plunge in an underground cavern with freshwater and enjoy a delicious meal at Hubiku restaurant, a traditional Yucatan cuisine buffet. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Ek Balam shares characteristics common to the most important ancient Mayan cities, including monuments, architecture, walls, stelae (beautiful sculptures carved from blocks of stone), a ball court, a network of roads as well as texts written in glyphs. Many buildings feature extraordinary sculptures carved in stone or modeled stucco, either polychromatic or a mixture. Visitors today are astonished by the craftsmanship of the ancient artists (shown in objects of luxury marks) and a large number of people necessary to produce projects of this magnitude. The Acropolis with its extraordinary facade is worth a special mention. Measuring 160 meters long by almost 70 wide and 31 high (95ft tall approx.), it is listed among the largest edifices in Yucatan. The most important discovery on the site was the discovery of the tomb of the ruler UkitKanLekTok. Here was found the only glyphic emblem found to date in the northern area of this state, giving the name of the king for whom the tomb was built. It dates back to 300 BC, before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.</p>
